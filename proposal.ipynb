    "Happiness, a subjective assessment of an individual’s emotional state/life satisfaction, can be affected by factors such as health and social network. As such, happiness can often act as an indicator for societal well-being (1). This report investigates how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the happiness of the world population. Ultimately, we hope to answer the question: **Did Covid-19 negatively impact levels of happiness**?\n",

    "**The Good**\\\n",
    "Our analysis shows that the majority of countries did not observe a change in happiness greater than 0.5 to -0.5. This report is trustworthy since the data is up-to-date and collected by dedicated and experienced researchers (2).\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Bad**\\\n",
    "The aforementioned mean change is insufficient because it lacks measures of uncertainty due to variance. Furthermore, by aggregating every country, we lose insights that may be revealed in different groupings like geographical regions. Lastly, we consider 2019 to be \"before COVID-19\" and 2021 to be \"after COVID-19\", but this may not be applicable to all countries' situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Solution**\\\n",
    "To include measures of uncertainty with our point estimate (mean change in happiness), we will perform hypothesis testing for establishing statistical significance of the results and calculate a confidence interval to quantify the errors when estimating the mean change in happiness between 2019 and 2021.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will perform a paired T-test because the two datasets sample the same countries over an interval of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our hypotheses are:  \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "H_0&: \\mu_{\\text{2021}} - \\mu_{\\text{2019}} = 0 \\\\ \n",
    "H_1&: \\mu_{\\text{2021}} - \\mu_{\\text{2019}} < 0 \\\\ \n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "* **Null Hypothesis**: There is no change in mean Happiness before and after COVID-19 throughout most countries.\n",
    "* **Alternative Hypothesis**: The mean happiness decreased after COVID-19 throughout most countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The significance level will be 0.05 with a corresponding confidence level of 95% (1- $\\alpha$) to reduce the risk of type II errors. We will use the bootstrapping method with set.seed() for reproducibility as this does not require any assumptions about the population distribution (compared to using asymptotic approaches)."

    "**Expected Findings**\\\n",
    "We expect that COVID-19 decreased happiness levels due to the effects of lockdown; studies done on the effects of vitamin D deficiency from lack of sunlight (3) and staying indoors (4) found negative impacts such as depression.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Impacts**\\\n",
